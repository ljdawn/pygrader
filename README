This is the tool which I created when teaching an introduction to programming course.  It is designed to:

* pull student assignments from a git repo
* run automated checks on them
* assist with composing additional feedback
* push results and feedback back to student repositories

It also has some miscellany, like generating ascii-art graphs of student scores.
